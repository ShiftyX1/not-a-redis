# (not) a Redis

A toy implementation of a Redis-like server in C++.
This is a learning project for me to understand how Redis works internally. It is not intended for production use.

Thanks to [Build-your-own-X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) repository for helping me get started with this project!
